To naturally test the agent-database binding, run the chat application
  and engage in typical coding conversations over 2-3 days without
  restarting the app. Start by discussing a specific project (like "I'm
  building a Python Flask API for user authentication") and ask for code
  examples, explanations, and troubleshooting help. The system should
  learn your preferences for Flask over Django, detect that you prefer
  detailed code examples, and remember your authentication project
  context. After 10-15 messages, restart the application to test
  persistence - when you resume conversations, the agent should reference
  your Flask project and previous discussions without you repeating
  context. Continue with different topics (database design, frontend
  frameworks, deployment) to build a diverse conversation history. Within
  24-48 hours of mixed usage, you should notice responses becoming more
  tailored - mentioning Flask when you ask about web frameworks, providing
   code-heavy responses if you typically request examples, and referencing
   previous project discussions. Test natural language database queries by
   asking "How many conversations have we had?" or "What topics have we
  discussed?" The system should process these as database queries and
  provide accurate results. For optimal testing, keep the application
  running for 4-6 hours during active development sessions, then restart
  to verify persistence, allowing the system to accumulate meaningful
  interaction patterns while demonstrating that learned context survives
  application restarts.
